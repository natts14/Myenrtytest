                <td><img src="images/maya pitbull hero.jpg"><br>Maya(Pit Bull)<br><label class="description">We heard of superheroes and cops regularly saving he courageously saved her parent from a male attacker in her home. Angela had just come home from her birthday party when a shadowy figure from behind suddenly decided to lunge forward and attack her, eventually reaching out to strangle her after she yelled out to deter/scare him. Luckily for her, Maya sensed her danger and came out to her rescue. The normally calm and collected pit bull started chomping down his arm in a brave attempt to chase off the perpetrator. Initially, he tried to fend off Maya with one hand and strangled Angela with the other. However, Maya proved to be too much for the attacker and he eventually retreated. The attacker, Anthony Easley, was caught a few months later- by examining a sample of blood collected from Maya herself.Maya received widespread praise after this incident became public knowledge, and had subsequently been named hero dog of the year 2008.</label></td>
                <td><img src="images/brutis retriever dog hero.jpeg"><br>Brutis(Golden Retriever)<br><label class="description">quickly snatched up the snake and went away before the snake could get to the boy. As a result, Brutis suffered a near-deadly bite from the snake but eventually made a full recovery. Venomous Coral snakes are known for being one of the most poisonous snakes in North America, and it could have been fatal had it bit the child. Luckily, Brutis did not hesitate for a second longer and risked himself anyways. His heroics did not go unnoticed, and he was soon flown to Los Angeles to receive the National Hero Dog award.“When we give an award like this, we’re looking for something extra, something that would make people wonder why a dog would do what he did.” said the committee who awarded him this award.</label></td>
                <td><img src="images/ginny schnauzer hero.jpg"><br>Ginny(Schnauzer)<br><label class="description">Ever heard of a canine who has a huge soft spot for felines? Ginny the Schnauzer certainly fits that criteria! Ginny is very well known as the dog who saves cats. And no, she didn’t just save one cat- she had saved hundreds! Getting off to a rough start in life, she was rescued on the verge of death and adopted by a depressed man called Philip Gonzalez. He soon realized how special his dog actually was. Turns out, Ginny was on a very special mission. Throughout the years, she had saved cats from all sorts of dangerous situations. Such famous escapades that made some headlines including: throwing herself down a pipe to save 5 kittens and saving a kitten through broken glass which resulted in her sustaining injury to her paws. During the course of her life, she had saved roughly 900 cats from all over the place- be it alleyways, shelters, buildings, dumpsters, you name it. Her life goal was always to be out in the world, offering aid to whoever needs it.</label></td>

                <td><img src="images/shana shepherd hero.jpg"><br>Shana(German Shepherd)<br><label class="description">An elderly couple, Eve and Norman Fertig, was taking care of animals on their sanctuary grounds when a freak snowstorm suddenly trapped them 200 ft away from home and in freezing temperatures. Luckily for them, Shana was there to save the day! With some determination, she dragged the couple through 200ft of snow in order to get them back to warmth and safety. She even stayed around after the long crawl in order to keep the couple warm and safe before the firemen rescue team arrived. Of course, she received widespread praise for her heroic deeds and was subsequently awarded the Citizens for Humane Animal Treatment’s Hero’s Award- an award usually reserved for humans.</label></td>

                <td><img src="images/belle beagle hero.jpg" ><br>Belle(Beagle)<br><label class="description">Kevin Weaver was suffering from diabetes during this time, and had a trained beagle named Belle to assist him with many things like detecting his blood sugar level at all times. One day, he suddenly suffered from an intense seizure and collapsed. In an awe-inspiring moment, our canine hero quickly grabbed the nearest phone and bit down the numbers ‘911’. Due to her heroic actions, her owner was eventually rescued. After her heroics, Belle had since been awarded the VITA Wireless Samaritan Award, which is given to someone who used a cellular device to save a life, prevent a crime or help in an emergency. Of course, it goes without saying that she is the first canine recipient of the award. “There is no doubt in my mind that I’d be dead if I didn’t have Belle,” said Weaver, who had recovered from his symptoms since.</label></td>

                <td><img src="images/eve rottweiler hero.jpg"><br>Eve(Rottweiler)<br><label class="description">This story takes place all the way back in 1991. Katie Vaughn, a 41 year old paralyzed woman, had just begun to smell smoke in the car- obviously a very suspicious sign already. Soon enough, her intuitions were right as she detected smoke pouring out of the engine compartment. She tried assembling her foldable wheelchair in order to escape but the smoke eventually grew too strong, overwhelming her. Luckily, her Rottweiler was there to rescue her! She quickly grabbed her by the leg and had managed to pull her out of the van before it caught fire and ultimately exploded! Luckily, they made it just in time and Mrs.Vaughn did not suffer from any injuries, although Eve suffered some burns on the pads of her paws as a result of her heroic deed. </label></td>
                <td><img src="images/toby retriever dog.jpg"><br>Toby(Golden Retriever)<br><label class="description">Debbie Parkhurst, 45 years old when the incident took place, was enjoying an apple when a big chunk of apple suddenly got lodged in her throat. She first attempted to perform a Heimlich Maneuver on herself, but she failed to get the piece out and desperately resorted to beating her own chest.Luckily for her, Toby, her 2 year old Golden Retriever, took notice of this and decided to take the initiative. He quickly got up on his hind feet, brought his owner onto the ground, and started jumping up and down her stomach with force. This led to the apple piece eventually being coughed out of Mrs.Parkhurst’s throat, saving her life. Besides the bruises that Toby inflicted in the process of saving her life, she was unhurt otherwise and is very thankful for her dog’s reaction.</label></td>
                <td><img src="images/clobberhead greyhound hero.jpg"><br>Clobberhead(Greyhound)<br><label class="description">Two months after Clobberhead was adopted by the Cramer family, he literally prevented a potentially deadly disaster using his sharp senses. With his ever-efficient nose, he knew from the very start that something was wrong in the house. He displayed some weird behaviours in order to grab his owner’s attention- behaviours such as avoiding a certain room or refusing to go out of the house. Finally, someone in the family, Erin Cramer, took heed of these strange behaviours and went to investigate. Clobberhead led the way, guiding her to some shocking discoveries. She discovered two major faults in her home- a gas leakage and her hot water heater giving out sparks. These 2 hazards combined would have destroyed not only her house, but her surrounding neighbour’s houses as well.  Thanks to Clobberhead’s smart thinking, several houses were saved from a catastrophe. Imagine the disastrous consequences had they decided not to adopt him that day. Sometimes, an act of compassion and kindness certainly goes a long way.</label></td>
